Task
You will make an ecommerce store that sells albums. For simplicity sake, the id will be the price of album.

1. Go to https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/ and learn how their fake api works
2. Make a page http://localhost/store that displays your store. On your store, 
you will show cards of the album with title, price and a button to buy. 3 cards per row. 
Should work on mobile as well.
3. Integrate store with [Stripe](https://stripe.com/docs/payments/accept-a-payment#php) so when they click buy, 
it gets processed by stripe and you save a record of payment in database.
4. Once processed payment, show thank you page.
5. Make a fake Email service that sends reciept(But really just error_log email). 
This Email service can be substituted for the real one anytime.
