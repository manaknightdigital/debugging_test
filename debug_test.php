//Question #3: During a large data migration, you get the following error:

Fatal error: Allowed memory size of 134217728 bytes exhausted (tried to allocate 54 bytes). 
You've traced the problem to the following snippet of code:

How would you refactor this code so that it stops triggering the memory error.
